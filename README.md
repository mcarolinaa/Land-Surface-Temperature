# Land-Surface-Temperature
Determination of Land Surface Temperature using Satellite imagery

# What
This is a short tutorial on how to calculate land surface temperature of an area, by means of satellite imagery.
Land Surface Temperature can be used for several studies and application in environmental, agriculture and meteorology areas, as well as their combination. Thus, generated data here constitute an initial step for several studies.

# Requirements
* Landsat 8 imagery (I used 2,3,4,5 and 10 bands)
* QGIS (I used v. 3.10.4)

# How (Main steps)
1. Download Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS products
2. Import band 2,3,4,5 and 10 on QGIS
3. Make a true-color composition band
4. Follow the steps in the LST file
